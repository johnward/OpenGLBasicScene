# OpenGL Basics

This project has been used for me to get back up to speed with OpenGL / Graphics programming, as I have 20+ years C++ and have a few years graphics device driver / OpenGL (originally the fixed function pipeline) experience.

##This covered in this repo are the following

* Shaders and triangle
* Uniform Variables
* Identity Matrices
* Transforming: Translation, Rotation and Scaling
* Interpolation
* Indexed Draws
* Projections
* Implementation of a basic camera
* GLFW Keyboard input
* Textures / Image Loading
* Lighting - Phong Lighting Model
* Model Loading
